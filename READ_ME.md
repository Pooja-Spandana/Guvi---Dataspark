# DataSpark: Illuminating Insights for Global Electronics

## Project Overview
- **DataSpark** is a data analytics project designed to extract valuable insights from Global Electronics' datasets.
- The project focuses on **data cleaning**, **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, and **creating actionable business insights**.
- Target areas include enhancing marketing strategies, optimizing inventory management, and supporting strategic decision-making in the electronics retail industry.

## Key Phases of the Project

1. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**
   - Handled missing values, converted data types, and cleaned numerical columns.
   - Loaded cleaned data into a MySQL database, including customer, sales, product, and exchange rate information.
   - Ensured data was ready for detailed queries and integration with visualization tools.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Utilized Python to explore customer demographics, purchase patterns, sales trends, and product performance.
   - Generated summary statistics, examined correlations, and visualized data through charts and graphs.
   - Provided insights into customer behavior, sales trends, and product performance.
